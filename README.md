# CVE bug example

This repository reproduces a bug when a library is wrongly recognized and CVEs from other library are reported
for it.

## Issue description

There is a `test-module` module which uses dependency `test-dependency`. Because `test-dependency` has version
matching one of the existing jenkins release plugin version, and it also adds jenkins-release-xyz to a
MANIFEST.MF file, it is treated as jenkins release library and two CVE are reported for this project despite
it does not exist in CVE database:

- [CVE-2018-1000013](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1000013)
- [CVE-2020-2292](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2292)

This is probably because of such defined cpe:

```
cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:release:*:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*
```

`test-dependency` has such content in its MANIFEST.mf file:

```manifest
Manifest-Version: 1.0
Created-By: Maven JAR Plugin 3.3.0
Build-Jdk-Spec: 17
Build-Tag: jenkins-release-1.2.0

```

## Generating report

To reproduce this bug, run:

```bash
mvn clean install
mvn dependency-check:aggregate validate -Powasp
```

The generated report can be found in target directory. There is also a `dependency-check-jenkins.html` file
pushed to this repository to show the result of this operation.
